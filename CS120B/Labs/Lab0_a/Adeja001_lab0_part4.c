 *	Assignment: Lab #0  Exercise # Chapter 3 Try 17
 *	Exercise Description:
 *	Run the above program. Set A to 2 and note from the printed output that the inner while loop body executes twice, and the result is 4, which appears on B. Set A to 0 and note that the inner while loop body does not execute, and the result is 1. Set A to 15 and note that the result is 32768, though B does not show that value because Bâ€™s 8 bits cannot represent numbers larger than 255.
